1. Delivery Process
Timeframes: The T&C should specify estimated delivery times (e.g., "within 7 business days" or "delivery within 30 days from order confirmation"). Be aware of whether these times are guaranteed or simply estimates, and what happens if the delivery is delayed.
Shipping and Handling: This section should cover the shipping methods (e.g., standard, expedited), and any shipping or handling fees that may apply. Look for whether these fees are included in the total price or if they are charged separately.
Tracking: Does the company provide a tracking number or service to monitor the delivery status of your purchase?
Shipping Restrictions: Are there any limitations on where the product can be delivered? For example, does the company only deliver within certain regions or countries, and are there any restrictions on international shipments (e.g., customs fees, taxes)?
2. Delivery Costs
Cost of Delivery: The T&C should outline who is responsible for paying delivery fees. Some companies offer free shipping above a certain order value, while others charge based on location, size, or weight of the items.
Handling Fees: Check if there are any additional handling fees that are separate from the shipping charges.
3. Delivery Risk and Responsibility
Transfer of Risk: This clause outlines when the risk of damage or loss transfers from the seller to the buyer. For instance, does the buyer take responsibility for the product as soon as it’s shipped, or is the seller responsible until it reaches the customer?
Ownership: Delivery terms often clarify when the ownership of the product officially transfers to the buyer (e.g., at the time of dispatch or upon receipt).
4. Delayed or Failed Deliveries
Consequences of Delay: What happens if the delivery is delayed? Some T&C include compensation for late delivery, such as partial refunds or the opportunity to cancel the order if it’s not delivered within a reasonable time frame.
Failed Delivery Attempts: How does the company handle situations where the delivery attempt fails (e.g., the recipient isn’t available to sign for the package)? Do they offer redelivery, or is it the buyer’s responsibility to pick up the package?
Force Majeure: Delivery delays might also be addressed under a force majeure clause. This covers situations beyond the company’s control (e.g., natural disasters, strikes, pandemics) that might affect delivery schedules.
5. Delivery Location and Restrictions
Address Accuracy: The buyer is usually responsible for providing an accurate delivery address. The T&C should specify what happens if the buyer enters the wrong address and whether there are any associated fees for reshipping or correcting the address.
Restricted Areas: Certain geographic areas might have restrictions for delivery (e.g., remote locations, post office boxes, international shipping), which should be clearly outlined in the T&C.
Third-Party Deliveries: If the company uses third-party couriers or delivery services (e.g., FedEx, UPS), the T&C should mention whether the company is liable for the delivery service's actions or delays.
6. International Delivery
Customs and Import Duties: If the company offers international delivery, the T&C should specify who is responsible for customs duties, import taxes, or any other charges associated with the delivery to other countries.
Customs Documentation: The document should also clarify if the company provides the necessary customs paperwork for international shipping or if it’s the buyer’s responsibility.
7. Returns and Delivery Failures
Return Shipping: What happens if the product needs to be returned due to a defect or wrong item delivered? The T&C should specify whether return shipping costs are covered by the seller or buyer.
Wrong Item or Defect: How does the company handle situations where the product is delivered damaged or isn’t what was ordered? You should be able to return the item without hassle in these cases.
8. Acceptance of Delivery
Inspection of Goods: The T&C should indicate whether the buyer is required to inspect the product upon delivery and report any issues (e.g., defects, damage) within a certain time frame (often 7 to 30 days).
Signing for Deliveries: Some deliveries may require a signature upon receipt. It should be clear who is authorized to sign (the buyer or a third party, such as a neighbor) and what happens if nobody is available to sign.
9. Subscription Services or Recurring Deliveries
Delivery Schedule: For subscription-based services (e.g., monthly deliveries), the T&C should specify the delivery frequency and any options for adjusting the delivery schedule (e.g., pausing or skipping a month).
Subscription Modifications: The document should explain how the delivery schedule can be changed and whether the customer can cancel their subscription at any time without penalties.
10. Failure to Accept Delivery
Undelivered Packages: What happens if a buyer refuses to accept delivery or the package is returned to the sender? Often, the company will either issue a refund (minus shipping) or reship the product at the buyer's expense.
Unclaimed Packages: If a package isn’t picked up, is there a time limit after which the product is considered abandoned? The T&C should clarify how long the company will hold onto the product before considering it unclaimed or canceled.
